excerpt: 'This paper describes an optimal trajectory planning algorithm for autonomous race car in high speed based on vehicle dynamics, considering that many of the trajectory planning algorithm can not handle the race car close to its stability limits.Firstly, a single track vehicle model is used as the plant,and extend with nonlinear Pacejka tire model and an aerodynamics model. Secondly, a time-optimal trajectory planning is formulated.Regularization terms is used to smooth the progress of the control inputs. Finally, an optimized trajectory for the autocross racetrack of Formula Student China in Zhuhai,PRC is planned. Compared with the trajectory without optimization, it is evident that the algorithm can push the autonomous race car to its stability limits and reward a great lap time.'
