I'm a first year PhD student in Control and Robotics Group, [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://www.eee.manchester.ac.uk/), [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/), advised by Professor [Guido Herrmann](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/guido.herrmann). My research primarily focuses on interactive environments simulation in self-driving, trying to reduce the sim2real gap of simualtion. My long term goal is to enable robots to interact and collaborate with people in daily life.

Previously, I earned my Bachelor’s Degree in Vehicle Engineering from Hunan University at Changsha in June 2020, and Master's Degree in Advanced Control & Systems Engineering with Extended Research from University of Manchester in July 2022.

Research interest:

  - Multi-agent Systems
  - Learning-based Robotics
  - Self-driving Simulation
